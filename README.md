# LaunchX-FrontEnd-WK1-Requirements
A set of requirements I wrote for a hypothetical website, made for the first of LaunchX's FrontEnd Assignments.

While I put more time on the requirements and the wireframe, I must acknowledge that they're lacking, due to both a lack of practice on writing requirements, and time.

I would love to receive feedback on the requirements!

Also wrote a Buyer Persona, Target Audience, some Wireframe screens, and a UI, for which I just made a quick design with one screen, just to show off the colors and whatnot. Again, not much time!
